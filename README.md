**College Inquiry Chatbot**

Built a conversational Chatbot powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. Here's how it works:

Learning from Examples: The chatbot is trained on a dataset of conversations, learning to associate text patterns with user intents (what the user wants to achieve).
Understanding Language: It uses NLP techniques like tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization to break down and understand user input.
Neural Network Brain: A neural network model analyzes the processed text, predicting the most likely intent behind the user's message.
Finding the Right Response: The chatbot selects a fitting response from its knowledge base, providing information or completing actions based on the predicted intent.

Key Technical Aspects:

NLP Libraries: NLTK
Machine Learning Framework: Keras
Data Format: JSON
GUI Toolkit: Tkinter
