# *College Inquiry Chatbot*
Built a conversational Chatbot powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. 

**Here's how it works**:

- Learning from Examples: The chatbot is trained on a dataset of conversations, learning to associate text patterns with user intents (what the user wants to achieve).
- Understanding Language: It uses NLP techniques like tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization to break down and understand user input.
- Neural Network Brain: A neural network model analyzes the processed text, predicting the most likely intent behind the user's message.
- Finding the Right Response: The chatbot selects a fitting response from its knowledge base, providing information or completing actions based on the predicted intent.

**Key Technical Aspects:**

- NLP Libraries: NLTK
- Machine Learning Framework: Keras
- Data Format: JSON
- GUI Toolkit: Tkinter

**Trained Model**

- Key Metric: Model achieves a remarkable 96.71% accuracy after 500 epochs, with a loss of only 0.1149.
- Epochs:  Training involved 500 complete passes through the dataset to refine the model.
- Time per Step (Os):  Computation time per step fluctuated slightly, likely measured in microseconds.
- Data per Epoch: The model likely processed 84 data points or batches within each epoch.
- Accuracy: The proportion of correct predictions made by the model steadily improved throughout training.
- Loss:  The difference between predicted and actual outputs decreased over time, indicating the model learned effectively.
